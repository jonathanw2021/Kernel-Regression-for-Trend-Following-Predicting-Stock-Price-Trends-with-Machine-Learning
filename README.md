Performing Kernel Regression on 5 Common Stocks for Trend Estimation" - A data-driven approach to identify market trends using kernel regression on stock prices

Description: In this project, we use a kernel regression technique to estimate trends in the stock prices of five common stocks (AAPL, META, GOOG, AMZN, NFLX) using historical data from 2016 to 2022. By fitting a linear regression model to the stock price data, we are able to obtain a smooth line of best fit that captures the overall trend in each stock's price movement over time.

With this trend estimation in hand, we develop a simple trading strategy based on a buy/sell signal that is triggered when the stock price moves above or below the trend line, respectively. We then simulate the performance of this strategy using historical data, and plot the daily returns and cumulative returns over the period of the simulation.

This project demonstrates the potential utility of machine learning algorithms in the field of finance, and highlights the importance of trend following in trading strategies.

We introduce in total 5 steps
1. Import Required Libraries
2. Get Data from yahoofinance
3. Choose kernel
4. Estimate Trends
5. Build a trading strategy
6. Plot Returns
